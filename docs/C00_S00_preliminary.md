# Some preliminary words

These course notes are document the material in the [CalcUA](https://hpc.uantwerpen.be)
course "Supercomputers for Starters" which itself has grown into a course covering more
than just the CalcUA infrastructure and may in the future also evolve to cover other similar courses.
It is often written in a rather informal style and isn't meant to be a book or so.

Disclaimer: This is unofficial documentation that is under continuous evolution. 
It is the result of my work at the 
[CalcUA service](https://hpc.uantwerpen.be)
of the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/) for the 
[Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum](https://vscentrum.be/). 

The latest version of the corresponding slides is available on the
[CalcUA training web page](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/core-facilities/calcua/training/).
There are also [video recordings from the November 2020 edition with some
updates from the spring 2021 edition](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/core-facilities/calcua/support/recordings/)
but these may not be world-visible.

    understand this stuff.
