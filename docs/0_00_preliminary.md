# Some preliminary words

These course notes are a work-in-progress to better document the material in the [CalcUA](https://hpc.uantwerpen.be)
course "Supercomputers for Starters" but may in the future also evolve to cover other similar courses.
It is often written in a rather informal style and isn't meant to be a book or so.



Disclaimer: This is unofficial documentation and work-in-progress. It is the result of my work at the 
[CalcUA service](https://hpc.uantwerpen.be)
of the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/) for the 
[Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum](https://vscentrum.be/).
